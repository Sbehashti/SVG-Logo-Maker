# SVG-Logo-Maker
## Creating A Node.js Application That Takes User Input, Creates A Logo, And Saves It As An SVG File.
### Demonstrating my knowledge of object-oriented programming, I was tasked with creating a Node.js application that takes in user input and creates a logo based on that input. The user is then prompted to save the logo as an SVG file.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input, WHEN I am prompted for text, THEN I can enter up to three characters;
- WHEN I am prompted for the text color, THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number);
- WHEN I am prompted for a shape, THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
- WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color, THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts, THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line;
- WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Work Completed
- When prompted for shapes, the user is presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
- When prompted for colors, the user can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- When prompted for text, the user can enter up to three characters
- When prompted for the text color, the user can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

## Work to Be Completed
- When all prompts are answered, the user is not prompted to save the logo as an SVG file, and multiple errors in code appear
- Logo is not generated and user is not prompted to save or view file
